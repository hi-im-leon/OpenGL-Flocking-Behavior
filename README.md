<h2>Bonus Challenge:</h2>

We implemented a flocking and seeking behavior for 20 individuals. The leader is colored a color, while all the other followers are a different color. 

To run the code:
<ol>
<li>Create a build file and run cmake ..</li>
<li>Make the files</li>
<li>Run ../bin/ChaseViewer</li>
</ol>

Some of the challenges we faced while making this file is adjusting the velocities and finding a proper way to ensure that they do not accrue or go overboard. While creating flocking behavior, we combine three behaviors: aligning, cohesion, and separation. Finding the appropriate balance is a bit of guess and check.

Forward Kinematics:
We finished this lab in class. We implemented all of the forward kinematics functions that were required from the lab. The hardest part was understanding matrix multiplication.

Curve Editor:
This lab took us 3 hours + cookie break. We implemented cubic splines + hermite splines. The hardest part of this lab was understanding how control points for a cubic spline worked. Control points in general are hard. 

Teapot:
I implemented 12 functions that would rotate the 7 teapots in sync with the master teapot. This was done using Euler Angle rotation matrices. This assignment took around 3 hours.
